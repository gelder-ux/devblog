Author's Note: This is the first post in a series dedicated to design systems. I am currently embarking on this journey within my organization. With this series, I hope to archive my thoughts here in order to not only crystalize my strategy, but to also help others on their path to design system nirvana. Hopefully, you glean from this series some ideas on how to navigate your organization and achieve a design system of your own.

Without further ado, I want to kick this post off with thoughts not about design systems per se, but about the context in which they exist: organizations.

# Your Organization is a Design System

## TL;DR
- A design system is more than a library of UI; it's the surrounding business that's necessary to support it too.
- If you create digital products, you are using a design system. Albeit it might be inefficient: copying and pasting code snippets, or more elegant: where you leverage a front end tooling pipeline.

As a designer, I love the concept of design systems. There are no lack of blog posts on the matter, and each one has more-or-less the same definition for them: A pattern library of user interface components, a living style guide, and documentation on when to use certain components. These are the tangible outputs. However, there are intangible - yet _very_ real - aspects to how a design system is incorporated. It's up to the organization whether or not a design system thrives.

## Value

A library of UI is only as valuable as its usage and cost-savings. If no one in your company acknowledges those two factors, then good luck getting permission to carve out time to work on it. Before long, it will be added to the pile of well-intentioned abandoned initiatives, and you as its designer will be allocated to a more practical project to make a quicker buck. 

Here's an unpopular opinion: 
>Your organization _is_ a design system, whether it's formalized that way or not. 

If you create digital products, you are using a design system. It might be inefficient such as copying and pasting code snippets, or more elegant such as leveraging NPM packages to manage UI dependencies. The level of elegance is governed by a couple of factors:
1. The scope of your products
2. The organization of people

## The Scope of Your Projects

If you have one or two products, chances are you can get away with the simple solution of designing, copying, and pasting between projects. If you have decades worth of products with no sign of slowing down, you're gonna' need a solid, scalable solution; one that involves far less glue and rubber bands...

## The Organization of People

If you have product-centric teams, you're gonna' have a tough time carving out a timeline to work on a design solution of any scale. There's just not enough head room for people to be working on several projects at once. If you have a design system team, then congrats! I have no idea how that feels.
